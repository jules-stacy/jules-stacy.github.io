I will give details about each graph and then as usual I will discuss the code used to generate them.


## Box Plots
![Salary by Career Length]({{ https://jules-stacy.github.io/ }}/assets/images/2-30-20-graphs/careersalary.png "boxplots of salary based on years of work experience")

The data for this graph was taken from the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset located here: https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
 
There are clear increases in salary amount at years 10 and 20, and the graph is designed in such a way that it highlights these salary increases.
