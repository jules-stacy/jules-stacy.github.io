I"p<p>A graph of taxi tip amounts based on pickup geocoordinates, programmed in R using ggplot2, ggmap, and open street maps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/green_taxi.png" alt="tip amount vs pickup location new york" title="a graph of pickup locations by geocoordinates, with tip amount mapped to color scale, and overlaid on top of a map of new york city" /></p>

<p>A standalone exercise in R, this graph is composed of a scatterplot of pickup locations in geocoordinates. The color of these points is then mapped to the amount received in tips, and the scatterplot is then overlaid on top of a map of New York City.</p>

<p>The scatterplot was constructed in ggplot2 and ggmaps was used to plot this on top of the map, which was obtained from Open Street Maps through a package named osmdata.</p>
