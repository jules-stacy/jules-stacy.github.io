<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This project was completed as a group of four individuals for a course in Machine Learning. Coded in Python, it makes use of the scikit-learn package (sklearn) and imbalanced-learn (imblearn) to develop a pipeline that performs a logistic regression and ultimately predicts whether guests are likely to cancel their hotel reservation.</p>
