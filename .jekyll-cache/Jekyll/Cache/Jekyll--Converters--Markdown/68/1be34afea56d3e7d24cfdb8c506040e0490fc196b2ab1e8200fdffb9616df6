I"=<p>A graph of taxi tip amounts based on pickup geocoordinates, programmed in R using ggplot2, ggmap, and open street maps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/green_taxi.png" alt="tip amount vs pickup location new york" title="a graph of pickup locations by geocoordinates, with tip amount mapped to color scale, and overlaid on top of a map of new york city" /></p>

<p>We were tasked with creating a visual that demonstrates where taxi drivers can expect to find the highest tips in New York City.</p>

<p>A standalone exercise in R, this graph is composed of a scatterplot of pickup locations in geocoordinates. The color of these points is mapped to the amount received in tips, and the scatterplot is then overlaid on top of a map of New York City.</p>

<p>The scatterplot was constructed in ggplot2 and ggmaps was used to plot this on top of the map, which was obtained from Open Street Maps through a package named osmdata.</p>

<h2 id="code-walkthrough">Code Walkthrough</h2>

<p>To recreate the graph, we will begin by importing packages used in the plotting process.</p>

<p>The dataset is too large to host on github so I am unable to provide it. Let’s see exactly how large it is.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s a lot of cab rides! There are 1,494,926 cab rides logged in the dataset, each with its own latitude and longitude for pickup location.</p>

<p>There are just too many points to make a readable graph using my available hardware. A minimum tip amount was arbitrarily chosen in order to cut down on the number of observations to be graphed. There is a lot of statistical groundwork that was skipped for this portion, and ultimately this constrains any conclusions to be drawn from the graphic to comparisons between tip amounts greater than the cutoff.</p>

<p>It will be a lot easier to visually represent 10.5 thousand points rather than 1.5 million points.</p>

<p>Now that I have the observations to be plotted, I can get the map that will serve as the background for the plot. To make it easier to zone in on the area I wish to include, I set the minimum and maximum latitude and longitude.</p>
