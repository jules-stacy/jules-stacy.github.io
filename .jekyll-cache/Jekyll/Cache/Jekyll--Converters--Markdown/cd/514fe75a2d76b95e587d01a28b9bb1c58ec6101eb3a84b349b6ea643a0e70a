I"ü<p>A logistic pipeline was developed to predict whether a guest would cancel their hotel reservation. Coded in Python.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This project was completed in a group of four individuals as part of a course in Machine Learning. Other aspects of the project are ongoing and use the same dataset.</p>

<p>Coded in Python, this project makes use of the scikit-learn package (sklearn) and imbalanced-learn (imblearn) to develop a pipeline that performs a logistic regression and ultimately predicts whether guests are likely to cancel their hotel reservation.</p>
